The following answers are for exercise 2.
=========================================

1) Method banana takes in an integer array and returns the product of its elements.
Argument a is the integer array of interest.
Variable kiwi is where the product is stored (and is initialized at 1 as a result).
Variable i is an iterator.

2) Method grapefruit takes in an integer array and an integer argument and returns the first index that contains the integer, or -1 if it does not exist.
Argument a is the integer array of interest.
Argument grape is the value checked for.
Variable i is an iterator.

3) Method pineapple takes in an integer array and an integer argument and returns the count of the number of times the integer argument appears in the array.
Argument a is the integer array of interest.
