# Computer Science Community Game Plan
## Interdisciplinary Activities
These activities are designed to help engage not just students, but the teachers in other disciplines as well. In order to raise computer science enrollment, we need teachers to be talking about it too.
### Calculators for Calculus
This is an activity I want to do that pairs high year comp sci students and calculus/precalculus students to try and make a "calculator" that finds things such as integrals, derivatives, limits, and more. It won't necessarily raise enrollment since it's a late-year idea, but it could be a nice integration that will raise _awareness_.
### Emulated Economics
This involves an economics or government focus which plays into almost a Game of Life setting, but with numbers and finances. Students work on building an artificial economy based around supply and demand and try to work on visualizing that data. The data may or may not be based on real-world events, but a database can easily bring that depth from a simple interface for students.
## Club Focuses
Much of this is already handled at my school by first cohort teacher Margie Monteleon, but I'll try and expand on it with what I can!
### Computational Math Challenge
I'm currently the coach/advisor for our Math Team, and I work closely with other advisors in our district. I'd love to bring up a challenge where students have to work together with comp sci students to make tools to solve math problems that need computational assistance in order to achieve the answers required.
### Math Team/Girls Who Code Collaborations
By fortune, and honestly by our community, our math team is almost entirely girls. So I want to parley that into an opportunity to work something out with Margie and see if I can't get compound interest into both our clubs.
