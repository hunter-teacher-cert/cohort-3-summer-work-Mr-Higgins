# Snap Pong Activity

### Be sure to accomplish this in https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html

#### In this project, you are going to model a computer game called Pong, first developed by Atari in 1972. You will write the  code for the paddle which will allow it to move up and down based on user keyboard input and also write the code for  the ball which will allow it to bounce every time it hits a wall or the paddle.

# PART I
	1.) Duplicate the code given below for the Paddle script. This code will enable the paddle to make contact with ball shape given.
	2.) The Paddle shape that you use can be similar or different than what is indicated below. You can change the color of  the paddle or use a different shape all together.
 
# PART II
	3.) Duplicate the code given below for the Ball script. This code will enable the ball to move constantly and make contact  with paddle shape given.
	4.) The Ball shape that you use can be similar or different than what is indicated below. You can change the color of the  ball or use a different shape all together. Save your work as U1l5Pong_Game.
   
# Part III
_Take it further_ - there are some hints toward the bottom to aid you with doing some of these questions.

* Create a tiny url and send this as an app to your phone.
* Change the background of the stage to a color of your choice.
* Add scoring to your game. Every time the paddles bounces off the ball, the player should earn a point and every time  the ball hits the right wall, the player should lose a point. You can create a variable to keep track of the score.
