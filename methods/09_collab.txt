Note: This is designed to be an activity attractive to both high level AP CSP students as well as senior math students coming in without a strong math background.

Assumptions: It is assumed students who get up to this activity have been
shown at least one searching algorithm and have an understanding of
procedural operation.

Reggie the Robot's Sorted Storage Activity
==========================================

Reggie the Robot is a recurring character in class, and this time a new
problem comes up.

All of Reggie's storage is always sorted alphabetically, closets included.
This makes it incredibly hard for Reggie to find what's needed for the
daily weather.

Students (groups of 4) are required to do the following:
1) Come up with 3 objects needed/worn in each weather type.
* Weather Types:
* * Sunny
* * Rainy
* * Snowy/Hailing
* * Sandstorm

# Teacher's Note: Suggest students take one weather and come up with 3
# objects.
# If you cannot only keep groups of 4, make some groups of 3 and suggest
# that they each suggest one object for each weather.

2) Establish roles (role-based groupwork):
* Sorter - Sorts the initial list of objects, and will document the "code"
  necessary to reach Reggie's goals.
* Searcher - Illustrates the run-time actions of the "code" necessary to
  reach Reggie's goals.
* Programmer - Formulates the "code" necessary to reach Reggie's goals.
* Debugger - Helps all others secure their roles, can also tag in or out
  of roles with others if necessary.

# Teacher's Note: I recommend the Debugger role for the highest performing
# student, that way other students can engage in that productive struggle,
# while being monitored by those more secure in the topic.

3) Determine how many "steps" it takes for Reggie to get ready for each
weather condition, using whichever search algorithm preferred.

# Teacher's Note: You can gauge student progress by prospection. Feel free
# to ask them what algorithm they're trying and see if their efforts align
# with what they say.
# If students are not engaging with the task because it is considered
# beneath their skill, add challenges such as "find an arrangement that is
# most efficient if the weather is most often sunny", or make two weathers
# depend on one object and ask them to run new tests on those "what-ifs".

========
Activity Goals: Through groupwork the students will recognize the steps of
algorithmic searching and compare and contrast searching for
humans vs. searching for machines.
